# CoffeeShop
Coffee Shop is a website used to manage a coffee shop by a manager, order by customers and confirm orders by Barista.
The site has three login permissions:

* Cafe manager - manager in charge of the management:
 Changing the availability of seats in the coffee shop.
 Menu management: changing the prices of the products in the menu, changing the availability of the products.

* Barista - Barista is responsible for confirming orders placed by customers, changing the condition of the tables to "available" (when customers vacated the seats).

* VIP customer - a customer who registers on the site receives discounts and discounted prices on the menu.

In addition to these permissions, the site is public and anyone can browse the site and place an order without the need to log in: by selecting products from the menu, choosing a seat (from the available seats) and making a payment.
